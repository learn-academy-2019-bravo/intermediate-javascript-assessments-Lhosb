### Without using Google answer the following:
1. What is the difference between .map() and .filter()?

  .filter() takes an array and filters certain elements from that array into another array. I think about .filter() as a forEach which uses .pop() to remove elements that meet a criteria.
  .map() takes an array and mutates certain values and puts them into another array. Its a forEach that changes values.

2. Why would you use object destructuring?

  Object destructuring allows for the coder to call on object keys/values without having to call on the object itself. It makes code earsier to read/write.

  The main difference between var, let, and const is scope. Const is used to define variables that are not meant to be changed. Let is used usually in a local scope to define variables that are dynamic. Var is used for cases inbetween.

4. Why is testing important?

Testing may also help the developer understand what is needed to code in the future to add new/necessary functionality.
